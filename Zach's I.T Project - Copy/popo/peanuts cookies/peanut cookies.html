    <h2>Peanut Butter Cookies</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Baking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add creamy peanut butter to the butter-sugar mixture and beat until well combined. Then, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on the prepared baking sheets. You can use a fork to create a crisscross pattern on the top of each cookie.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may still look slightly soft but will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, enjoy your classic Peanut Butter Cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
