    <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookie/Biscuit Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>- 3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>- 2 large eggs</li>
        <li>- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>- 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>- 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>- 2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Baking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). <br>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is well incorporated. <br>Add the vanilla extract and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between each for the cookies to spread.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. <br>The centers may still look slightly soft but will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, enjoy your classic Chocolate Chip Cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
